Pesto Mentee Tracker is an S/W for mentor, mentee, and program managers to easily share actionable items, manage meeting logs, and keep a tab on menteeâ€™s progress.
With this in place, managing feedback docs for each mentee will get easier, the mentee will have a single place for action items and the Pesto team can view progress so that the mentee can be mentored in the required area.


Welcome! we hope you enjoy the site as much as we enjoyed making it.

# Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
- [Redux-Tool-Kit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [ApexCharts](https://apexcharts.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
